# 🚀 AutoWiredGPT – LLM Integration Platform Powered by Spring Boot + OpenAI

A custom-built, Java-based AI assistant where I’ve integrated **chat memory**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, **tool capabilities**, and **prompt templates**.

🔗 **Neo4j for chat memory** – Keeps track of user sessions & history for contextual conversations  
📄 **Template-based prompts** – Users can summarize, expand, or simplify text in one click  
📚 **RAG support with vector embeddings** – Texts are embedded & stored in Pinecone for similarity-based retrieval  
🎧 **Audio transcription** – Users can convert audio into text with high accuracy  
🌐 **Web search integration** – AutoWiredGPT can retrieve information beyond the model's training cutoff

AutoWiredGPT is capable of supporting multiple users with distinct, persistent chat sessions, maintaining memory across sessions.
